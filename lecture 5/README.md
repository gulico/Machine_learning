# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

In this practice work you will deal with a dataset from machine learning competition platform Kaggle (kaggle.com).
This platform is created to make competitions between machine learning engineers and/or data analysts. 
If you want to increase your machine learning skills you could participate in competitions at this platform.

This practice work is dedicated to machine learning competitions like at the Kaggle platform. 
The dataset was taken from kaggle machine learning competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster". In this machine learning
task you will have to predict which passengers survived the Titanik shipwreck.

Taking 'train.csv' as the training dataset you should train the best machine learning model that you can 
and predict answers for 'test.csv'. Please, don't cheat and use 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' from the laboratory work directory.

Don't forget about these points:

1. Use cross-validation to estimate your model before sending answers to me
2. Analyze features in this dataset and try to combine them to create new features
3. Use features preprocessing (transformations and imputing) if need
4. Try to analyze the features' importance
5. Use different machine learning models and try to change parameters of training for them to achieve better results.

Here is work order:
0. You will be split into 4 teams (see '5th lab teams.xls'). The resulting score of this work will be set to all teammates equally.
1. Take the training dataset and train a machine learning model, estimate it, don't forget about the analysis of features.
2. Taking 'test.csv' predict the column 'survival' for this dataset.
3. Make an ipython notebook with an analysis of training data and update 'test.csv' by new column 'survival'.
4. Send the ipython notebook and updated 'test.csv' to my email on behalf of your team (with the subject 'ML competition Team #<the number of your team>').
5. I'll check your answers and score your work by some classification measure and send this score to you.
6. If you send this work before the deadline (17:00 of Beijing on Friday) you can resend it to achieve a better result.
7. After the deadline your last sendings will be used to estimate your work.

A team that takes the best result will be given the maximum score of this lab (10)
A team that achieves the second place will be given 9 points (or 10 if ipython notebook will contain a detailed analysis of the task)
A team that achieves the third place will be given 8 points (or 9 if ipython notebook will contain a detailed analysis of the task)
A team that achieves the fourth place will be given 7 points (or 8 if ipython notebook will contain a detailed analysis of the task)
