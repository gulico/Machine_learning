# Practice work description

In the second lab you should learn how to use scikit learn and pandas libraries in solving of machine learning tasks.
Also, you will get to know the k-nearest neighbors method.

Variants for your practice work are placed in a directory 'variants' and xls-file contains the number of your variant.

## Taks statement:

Please, investigate the "knn example" directory. This example shows how to use scikit learn's kNN method, pandas dataframes and 
how to estimate the machine learning classification algorithm in a simple manner. 
In according to you variant prepare ipython notebook file that solve regression or classification task using kNN approach and estimate
your model using accuracy and confusion matrix for a classification problem or r2_score for regression. 
Also, try to tune parameters of kNN algorithm to achieve better results in according to quality measure (accuracy or r2 score).
